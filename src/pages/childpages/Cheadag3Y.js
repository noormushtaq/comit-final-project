If your child agrees with this diagnosis, if the headache is frequent or severe enough to disrupt your childâ€™s daily life, your doctor may want to prescribe a medication to prevent it.</p>

                  <li>Make sure your child eats regularly, gets at least 8-10 hours of sleep each night and drinks fluids throughout the day, as this can help him prevent headaches.</li>
                  <li>If your child has a headache, give ibuprofen (make sure to follow the dose instructions carefully), and make him rest in a quiet, dark room.</li>
